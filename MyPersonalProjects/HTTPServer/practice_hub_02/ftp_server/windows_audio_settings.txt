why does windows OS fail to separate the sound adjustments that a user configures for headphones when plugged in and those for the speakers when the headphones are not plugged in, while on the other hand linux OS does exactly this, and as a use I prefer what linux OS does to what windows OS does?

That‚Äôs a great observation, Patrick ‚Äî and your preference for how Linux handles audio device configurations is shared by many users who value more granular control.



Here's a breakdown of why Windows doesn't separate sound settings for headphones and speakers by default, while Linux does:




ü™ü Windows: Unified Output Configuration



1. Device Grouping Philosophy


Windows treats headphones and speakers that use the same audio output port (like a 3.5mm jack) as the same device. This is especially true for onboard sound cards where the jack is shared. When you plug in your headphones, Windows sees it as "the same audio output" just rerouted ‚Äî not a new device.


	Result: The volume level, enhancements (like EQ settings), and other configurations are shared between the two.

	Design Choice: It simplifies the audio stack and user interface for non-technical users.




2. Driver Limitations and Vendor Influence


Windows audio behavior can also be heavily influenced by sound card drivers (e.g., Realtek, Conexant). Many of these drivers don‚Äôt expose separate device profiles for plugged vs unplugged states unless they are explicitly configured to do so.

Realtek HD Audio Manager, for instance, can be configured to treat the front and back audio jacks as independent devices, but this is not the default.





3. Focus on General Users


Windows aims to serve a wide range of users, prioritizing simplicity over customizability. As a result, more advanced options (like audio profiles per device) are buried or not even exposed by default.






üêß Linux: Device-Specific Audio Profiles (ALSA/PulseAudio/PipeWire)



1. Modular Audio System


Linux audio uses ALSA (kernel-level sound architecture) and user-level sound servers like PulseAudio or PipeWire.

These systems treat every physical audio device or port as a distinct audio sink/source.

When you plug in headphones, Linux often recognizes it as a new sink, allowing you to have independent volume and effects for each.





2. Persistent Settings


Many Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.) remember your per-device preferences, such as:

Output device volume

Balance

Effects and profiles

This behavior is by design, focusing on power user control and respecting device independence.






3. User-Centric Philosophy


Linux is built by and for users who often want full control over their system. This includes respecting the fact that headphones and speakers are used differently, and should behave differently.






üí¨ Why You Prefer Linux in This Case


You likely appreciate that Linux:

Treats each output device as a separate entity

Remembers and restores settings per device

Gives you fine-grained control without needing third-party software





üîß Can Windows Be Made to Work Like Linux Here?


Yes ‚Äî to some extent:

Use third-party software: Tools like EarTrumpet, Equalizer APO, or Audio Switcher can give you more per-device control.

Tweak your sound driver: For Realtek audio, for example, you can change settings in the Realtek Audio Console or the registry to separate front/back jacks as different devices.

But out-of-the-box, Linux wins for this specific case.
